//! Library for interacting with the kernel component of NBD, using ioctls.
//!
//! The setup implemented here is normally carried out by `nbd-client` on Linux.
//! The
//! [nbd-client.c](https://github.com/NetworkBlockDevice/nbd/blob/master/nbd-client.c)
//! source code was helpful for developing this library.
//!
//! The way the NBD API works is that loading the kernel module initializes the
//! devices `/dev/nbd0`, `/dev/nbd1`, and so on, as special files. Then the
//! kernel has a way of associating these files with remote servers; from then
//! on, block device operations on the NBD devices are translated into network
//! operations interacting with the remote end, following the protocol (the
//! kernel is the _client_ in these interactions).
//!
//! In order to set up a device with a remote server, the kernel uses `ioctl()`,
//! a general-purpose system call for interacting with drivers through special
//! files. NBD exposes two key `ioctl()`s: `NBD_SET_SOCK` passes a socket (as a
//! file descriptor) to the kernel, associating it to the NBD device, and
//! `NBD_CLEAR_SOCK` resets this state. There are a handful of other
//! configuration commands, but these are the most important.
//!
//! Note that the kernel implements only the transmission phase of the NBD
//! protocol and it is the job of the userspace process to create the socket
//! (e.g., create a TCP connection connected to a remote NBD server) and
//! negotiate with the remote end.
